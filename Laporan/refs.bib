    abstract  = {The incidence of primary cutaneous melanoma has increased steadily for several decades and remains the most lethal form of cutaneous neoplasm. If diagnosed in the early stages, melanoma has high survival rates, approximating 94\%. According to the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}), from 2014 to 2018, the incidence of metastatic melanoma was estimated to be 0.9 per 100,000. Mucosal and ocular melanomas typically have worse prognoses. Melanoma was once considered a very aggressive cancer that was resistant to traditional therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and even single-agent targeted therapies in their early stages of development. A dramatic improvement in the quality of life and overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma has resulted after the advent of various new combinations of targeted therapies and different modalities of immunotherapies.  Melanoma is distinct from nonmelanoma skin cancers because it spreads locally, regionally, and distantly. An individual's risk of metastasis is directly related to the depth of invasion and ulceration of the primary lesion. The early stages of cancer metastasis involve invasion, angiogenesis, extravasation, dissemination, and colonization of the target organ. Patients with clinically node-negative disease and those with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy can still present with distant metastatic disease. Moreover, complete lymph node dissection has not been proven to offer a survival benefit to patients with node-positive disease. There are reports of the transfer of melanoma from a donor to a recipient after an organ transplant, even when the transplant was performed years after the donor was diagnosed with melanoma. Such distant seeding suggests the possibility of early subclinical micrometastasis in melanoma. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO}), only about 4\% of melanomas are present with metastasis.  Patients typically present with an asymmetrical large lesion that may also itch, bleed, ulcerate, or develop satellite lesions. Patients who present with metastatic disease or with primary sites other than the skin have signs and symptoms related to the affected organ systems. Once a suspicious skin lesion is identified, a biopsy must be performed to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. An excisional biopsy is the preferred biopsy modality. Melanoma treatment typically involves wide local excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, digital amputations, or adjuvant therapy depending on tumor location, depth, ulceration, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3\% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1\% vs. 2.6\% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65\% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus-associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5\%), contributing to a 33\% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2\% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.},

	abstract = {Skin lesion is a severe disease in world-wide extent. Early detection of melanoma in dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons, e.g. low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. International Skin Imaging Collaboration ({ISIC}) is a challenge focusing on the automatic analysis of skin lesion. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address all the three tasks announced in {ISIC} 2017, i.e. lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two fully-convolutional residual networks ({FCRN}) is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit ({LICU}) is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward {CNN} is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. To our best knowledges, we are not aware of any previous work proposed for this task. The proposed deep learning frameworks were evaluated on the {ISIC} 2017 testing set. Experimental results show the promising accuracies of our frameworks, i.e. 0.718 for task 1, 0.833 for task 2 and 0.823 for task 3 were achieved.},

	abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. Correctly classifying skin lesions at an early stage could aid clinical decision-making by providing an accurate disease diagnosis, potentially increasing the chances of cure before cancer spreads. However, achieving automatic skin cancer classification is difficult because the majority of skin disease images used for training are imbalanced and in short supply; meanwhile, the model’s cross-domain adaptability and robustness are also critical challenges. Recently, many deep learning-based methods have been widely used in skin cancer classification to solve the above issues and achieve satisfactory results. Nonetheless, reviews that include the abovementioned frontier problems in skin cancer classification are still scarce. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest deep learning-based algorithms for skin cancer classification. We begin with an overview of three types of dermatological images, followed by a list of publicly available datasets relating to skin cancers. After that, we review the successful applications of typical convolutional neural networks for skin cancer classification. As a highlight of this paper, we next summarize several frontier problems, including data imbalance, data limitation, domain adaptation, model robustness, and model efficiency, followed by corresponding solutions in the skin cancer classification task. Finally, by summarizing different deep learning-based methods to solve the frontier challenges in skin cancer classification, we can conclude that the general development direction of these approaches is structured, lightweight, and multimodal. Besides, for readers’ convenience, we have summarized our findings in figures and tables. Considering the growing popularity of deep learning, there are still many issues to overcome as well as chances to pursue in the future.},

	abstract = {Melanoma being the most unpredictable and life-threating cancer, has been on the rise in recent times. In most of the cases being fatal, if treated early, the fatality rate might be lowered severely. Hands-on Melanoma detection at primary stages with the unassisted eye is error-prone and requires vast knowledge and experience. Number of expert dermatologists being inadequate, a computerized and automated approach is needed to accurately detect Melanoma. The following study tries to achieve this feat by developing a neural network that can effectively detect and classify Melanoma. The process begins with preprocessing of dermoscopic images to remove hairs with the Maximum Gradient Intensity algorithm and also enhancement of the images is done. Segmentation based on Otsu Thresholding algorithm is applied to separate skin lesions from the images. Multiple features like {ABCD}, {GLCM}, and {LBP} are then calculated from the segmented images which will be used to train a neural network. The network was successful to attain an accuracy of 97.7\% on the combined dataset of {ISIC} archive the {PH}2 dermoscopic image database. The proposed method was found to be more accurate than existing methods and encorporates much more feature information from the images.},

	abstract = {The abnormal growth of cells in the skin causes two types of tumor: benign and malignant. Various methods, such as imaging and biopsies, are used by oncologists to assess the presence of skin cancer, but these are time-consuming and require extra human effort. However, some automated methods have been developed by researchers based on hand-crafted feature extraction from skin images. Nevertheless, these methods may fail to detect skin cancers at an early stage if they are tested on unseen data. Therefore, in this study, a novel and robust skin cancer detection model was proposed based on features fusion. First, our proposed model pre-processed the images using a {GF} filter to remove the noise. Second, the features were manually extracted by employing local binary patterns ({LBP}), and Inception V3 for automatic feature extraction. Aside from this, an Adam optimizer was utilized for the adjustments of learning rate. In the end, {LSTM} network was utilized on fused features for the classification of skin cancer into malignant and benign. Our proposed system employs the benefits of both {ML}- and {DL}-based algorithms. We utilized the skin lesion {DermIS} dataset, which is available on the Kaggle website and consists of 1000 images, out of which 500 belong to the benign class and 500 to the malignant class. The proposed methodology attained 99.4\% accuracy, 98.7\% precision, 98.66\% recall, and a 98\% F-score. We compared the performance of our features fusion-based method with existing segmentation-based and {DL}-based techniques. Additionally, we cross-validated the performance of our proposed model using 1000 images from International Skin Image Collection ({ISIC}), attaining 98.4\% detection accuracy. The results show that our method provides significant results compared to existing techniques and outperforms them.},
