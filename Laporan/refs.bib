	abstract = {With the exponential growth in the production creation of multimedia data, there is an increasing need for video semantic analysis. Audio, as a signiﬁcant part of video, provides important cues to human perception when humans are browsing and understanding video contents. To detect semantic content by useful audio information, we introduce audio keywords which are sets of speciﬁc audio sounds related to semantic events. In our previous work, we designed a hierarchical Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) classiﬁer for audio keyword identiﬁcation. However, a weakness of our previous work is that audio signals are artiﬁcially segmented into 20 ms frames for frame-based {SVM} identiﬁcation without any contextual information. In this paper, we propose a classiﬁcation method based on Hidden Markov Modal ({HMM}) for audio keyword identiﬁcation as an improved work instead of using hierarchical {SVM} classiﬁer. Choosing {HMM} is motivated by the successful story of {HMM} in speech recognition. Unlike the frame-based {SVM} classiﬁcation followed by major voting, our proposed {HMM}-based classiﬁers treat speciﬁc sound as a continuous time series data and employ hidden states transition to capture context information. In particular, we study how to ﬁnd an eﬀective {HMM}, i.e., determining topology, observation vectors and statistical parameters of {HMM}. We also compare diﬀerent {HMM} structures with diﬀerent hidden states, and adjust time series data with variable length. Experimental data includes 40 minutes basketball audio which comes from real-time sports games. Experimental results show that, for audio keyword generation, the proposed {HMM}-based method outperforms the previous hierarchical {SVM}.},
